                    I was born in town of Jaysingpur on 23/6/2000. I was in Jaysingpur for three years of my life.
                    I moved to town of Kurundwad in 2003 where my Dad practised his dentistry.
                    From then onwards I was in Kurundwad until 7/4/2016 when I moved to Andheri, Mumbai for my Jee Preparations.
                    I succeeded in Jee and got admission into IITB. From 21/07/2018 onwards I am here in Powai, Mumbai @ IITB.
